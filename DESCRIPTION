Description: 'valgrind' is a system for debugging and profiling that runs on
    Unix-based systems. With 'valgrind' you can detect memory leaks in a variety
    of ways. This package provides an R interface to the 'valgrind' tool suite.
    It allows you to run 'valgrind' from R, retrieve the output, and process it
    in R.
